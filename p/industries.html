            <!-- DISH Wireless story -->
            <h3>DISH Wireless</h3>
            <blockquote>DISH Wireless taps Oracle for cloud native 5G core in greenfield network buildout.</blockquote>
            <div class="centered-img">
                <img src="/content/images/pages/industries/rc24-dish.jpg">
            </div>
            <p>DISH Wireless is redefining services for consumers, small businesses and large enterprises by building the nation’s first cloud-native, OpenRAN-based 5G network. As DISH takes the unprecedented step of building a 5G network in the cloud, it has selected Oracle to enable a Service-Based Architecture (SBA) for its 5G core. SBA, part of the 3GPP 5G standard, enables network services to be rapidly incorporated into new applications by DISH or DISH customers through automated, intelligent configuration between network functions.<br>
            With this technology, DISH Wireless will be able to provide enterprise customers added control of the software and services they utilize, taking advantage of their individual “network slice.” This “network of networks” will enable enterprises to configure dedicated, logical network instances and policy management for different applications and customer experience models, such as manufacturing or telehealth.<br>
            “Oracle’s capabilities will essentially serve as the control tower of our network core, enabling our customers to consume software on demand and facilitating the advanced core functions required to power a truly automated network,” said Marc Rouanne, chief network officer, DISH Wireless. “While many carriers may claim to have 5G, there are certain attributes only possible with a cloud-based standalone network, and our working with Oracle will yield results that will unleash the power of true, fully-optimized 5G.”<br>
            Aligned with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), Oracle’s 5G core control plane includes network functions that will help operators automate and scale to meet the expected growth in 5G subscribers and connected devices. DISH Wireless will be using a number of network functions from Oracle including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.oracle.com/industries/communications/5g-core/"><strong>Policy Control Function (PCF):</strong></a> dynamically routes low-latency applications to edge data networks, while simultaneously considering network data analytics and slice information to provide optimized policies minimizing network resource utilization while maximizing quality of experience.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.oracle.com/industries/communications/5g-core/"><strong>Network Repository Function (NRF):</strong></a> serves as a central repository for all of the network functions in DISH&rsquo;s 5G network, along with the services provided by each of these elements.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.oracle.com/industries/communications/5g-core/"><strong>Network Exposure Function (NEF):</strong></a> acts as a centralized point for service exposure and plays a key role in authorizing all access requests originating from outside the DISH network to enable Cellular IoT, non-IoT, edge computing and API gateway use cases for DISH and its enterprise customers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additionally, DISH will utilize Oracle for 5G Service Communications Proxy (SCP), Network Slice Selection Function (NSSF), Security Edge Protection Proxy (SEPP) and Binding Selection Function (BSF).</p>
            <h4>A network built for 5G</h4>
            <p>DISH Wireless is entering the 5G market with a business strategy completely built on innovation. The company is aiming to offer thousands of network slices, each with a tailored customer experience leveraging network and subscriber-level service data. The Oracle network control functions will enable DISH to easily create and manage custom, service-specific network slices, deliver powerful policy control and provide granular access to third party-enterprises and web applications. These features will support use cases such as enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (uRLLC), Mobile Internet of Things (mIoT), and User Equipment (UE) policies. With support for DevOps principles and continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), Oracle’s cloud-native architecture will enable DISH to reduce operational expenses and time to market for these new services.</p>
            <p>“DISH Wireless is completely disrupting the wireless industry,” said Andrew Morawski, senior vice president and general manager, Oracle Communications, Networks. “Using Oracle’s 5G cloud-native technology to automate their network, DISH will be one of the most agile operators in the world enabling enterprise digital transformation journeys across many diverse industries.”</p>

            <!-- McCarthy story -->
            <h3>McCarthy</h3>
            <blockquote>Sustainable infrastructure projects fueled by Oracle innovation.</blockquote>
            <div class="centered-img">
                <img src="/content/images/pages/industries/construction.jpg">
            </div>
            <p>An increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius is the threshold, according to the UN climate body, that would mean the difference between livable and never seen before devastation.</p>
            <p>Whether you believe that an increased global temperature is to blame for the recent rise in natural disasters or not, the reality of these events results in loss of life and economic impacts.</p>
            <p>At a time when infrastructure projects look to rebuild economies, create jobs, and improve quality of life, how we build is an important component to what we build. Preventing continuous increases in carbon emissions is a good practice and will require efforts and changes from every industry, and at every stage of the asset lifecycle.</p>
            <p>The construction industry has not been viewed as a pioneer of sustainability measures. But that looks to be changing, possibly due to pressure from investors. It has been estimated that construction accounts for nearly 40 percent of global emissions, 28 percent of which comes from raw-material manufacturing, according to McKinsey.</p>
            <p>If left unchecked, carbon output from construction could grow over the next 30 years due to demands of an expanding population.</p>
            <p>To effectively drive green infrastructure construction, a whole-lifecycle framework will be required that may include new policies and regulations. PwC stated in their blog <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/capital-projects-infrastructure/publications/infrastructure-trends/global-infrastructure-trends-developments-in-sustainability.html#the-rise-of-stranded-assets">Global Infrastructure Trends</a> that “multilateral development banks (MDBs) are prioritizing inclusive, resilient and sustainable technology-driven infrastructure.”</p>
            <p>Public agencies should create a prioritized list of programs and projects that will attract sustainable infrastructure investments.</p>
            
            <h4>Technology that can help construction reduce carbon</h4>
            <p>Predicting natural disasters or other effects climate change could have on assets is a difficult task and could pose a challenge for investors. Smart applications, purpose-built for construction, can improve decisions, provide insights, and help mitigate risks.</p>
            <p>“Technology offers every organization in the world an opportunity to help reduce carbon emissions,” said Richard Petley, senior vice president and managing director, technology and cloud, Oracle UK and Western Europe.</p>
            <p>Oracle Construction and Engineering software helps by streamlining project management and construction time—the less time a project takes, the smaller its environmental impact.</p>
            <p>Scenario planning tools in <a href="https://www.oracle.com/construction-engineering/primavera-cloud-project-management/">Oracle Primavera Cloud Service</a> allow you to perform multiple what-if models to better plan, even when uncertainty exists. Portfolio optimization lets agencies prioritize projects and create alternate plans in the case of blockers.</p>
            <p>And budget planning and funding functionality allows for tracking funding sources and how the money is being spent for better transparency and traceability.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.oracle.com/construction-engineering/unifier-asset-lifecycle-management/">Oracle Primavera Unifier’</a>s business process automation speeds up review and approval time, ensures nothing falls through the cracks, and drives compliance. Dashboards can show key metrics by project or vendor, making it easier to furnish reports to governments and shareholders for better transparency.</p>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.oracle.com/construction-engineering/construction-intelligence-cloud/">Oracle Construction Intelligence Cloud Service</a> uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to leverage the vast amount of data from an agency’s past projects to predict potential risks on current projects, giving you insights you can act upon and enables data-informed decisions.</p>
            <p>Connecting people, processes, and data across all teams and stakeholders is crucial to project momentum and avoiding risk. A good example of this is the Mayflower Wind project off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard in New England.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.oracle.com/industries/construction-engineering/aconex-project-controls/">Oracle Aconex</a> software helped shorten the time to route and track the comprehensive permitting process at the federal, state, regional, and local government levels by up to 60 percent.</p>
            <p>With multiple government agencies and vendors involved in the project, “it is hard to even imagine managing the permitting process without Oracle Aconex,” says Weronika Nowak, document control manager for Mayflower Wind.</p>
            <p>When completed, the farm has the potential to generate over 2,000 megawatts (MW) of low-cost clean energy and has a planned asset life of 30-plus years, making it critical that the wind farm operate as efficiently as possible to maximize the life of the equipment and continue to offset carbon emissions.</p>

            <h4>Doing our part: Helping industries reduce carbon</h4>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.oracle.com/industries/innovation-lab/">Oracle Industries Innovation Lab</a> in Reading, UK, will open in the spring of 2022. At the lab, customers and partners will experiment with innovative strategies to lower carbon outputs in alignment with UN, British government, and Oracle corporate goals.</p>
            <p>The materials for the lab facility—from carpeting and wood to concrete and steel—are sourced in ways that reduce carbon. By saving so much carbon, the site will offset its emissions and demonstrate carbon reduction strategies for customers.</p>
            <p>Oracle’s innovation labs in <a href="https://www.oracle.com/industries/innovation-lab/">Chicago</a> and Reading will continue working closely with the construction industry, along with utilities, communications, food and beverage, hospitality, and transportation.</p>
            <p>Geoff Roberts, Oracle’s director of energy industry strategy who will manage the new lab, says smaller carbon footprints start with the basics of construction.</p>
            <p>“Take steel and concrete, which are only two elements of a major project. We’re starting to see low-carbon choices in both materials. Construction environments must be sustainable throughout.”</p>
