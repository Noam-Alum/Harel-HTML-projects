  <h1>Introduction to Taki</h1>
  <section>
    <p>Taki is a popular card game originating in Israel, known for its fast-paced and strategic gameplay. Often referred to as "Israeli Uno," it shares similarities with the well-known game Uno, but with a few unique twists that give it its own flair. Created in the 1980s by an Israeli game designer, Taki quickly became a beloved pastime among Israeli families and spread globally.</p>

    <h2>Objective of the Game</h2>
    <p>The goal of Taki is simple: be the first player to get rid of all your cards. Much like Uno, players take turns playing cards from their hand, matching either the color or the number of the top card in the discard pile. However, the game introduces special action cards, rules, and strategies that make it more dynamic and challenging.</p>
    
    <h2>Overview of the Taki Deck</h2>
    <p>The Taki deck consists of 112 cards, broken down into different colors (red, yellow, green, and blue) and several types of action cards. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Number Cards</strong>: Cards numbered 1-9 in each color (red, yellow, green, blue).</li>
        <li><strong>Taki Cards</strong>: A special card that allows the player to continue playing cards of the same color.</li>
        <li><strong>Stop Cards</strong>: A card that stops the turn of the next player.</li>
        <li><strong>Plus Cards</strong>: A card that forces the next player to pick up two cards.</li>
    </ul>
