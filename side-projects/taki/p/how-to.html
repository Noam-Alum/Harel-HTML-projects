    <h2>Setting Up the Game</h2>
    <p>Taki can be played with 2-10 players, and each player starts with 8 cards. The dealer shuffles the deck and distributes the cards, ensuring each player has a hand of 8 cards. The remaining cards form the draw pile, and the top card is flipped over to start the discard pile.</p>
    
    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>Players take turns clockwise, with each player playing one card from their hand. The card played must match the color or number of the card at the top of the discard pile. If a player cannot play a card, they must draw a card from the deck. If they can play the drawn card, they do so immediately. If not, their turn ends.</p>
    
    <h2>Special Cards and Actions</h2>
    <p>During the game, players can use special cards like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Taki Cards</strong>: When a player plays a Taki card, they can continue playing as long as they match the color.</li>
        <li><strong>Stop Cards</strong>: This card halts the next player's turn.</li>
        <li><strong>Plus Cards</strong>: This forces the next player to draw two cards and skip their turn.</li>
    </ul>
