    <h1>Winning the Game</h1>

  <section>
    <p>The game continues until one player has no cards left in their hand. That player is declared the winner. However, there are a few additional rules to consider:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Calling "Taki"</strong>: When a player is down to their last card, they must call out "Taki" before their next turn. If they fail to do so and another player notices, they must draw two cards as a penalty.</li>
        <li><strong>Calling "Stop"</strong>: If a player has a Stop card and plays it, they can prevent another player from playing for one round.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Though the objective is to get rid of all your cards, the game is fast and can shift quickly due to the strategic use of special cards. The mix of strategy and luck makes Taki a fun and exciting game for players of all ages.</p>
